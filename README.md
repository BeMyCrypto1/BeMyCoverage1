## üéØ Project Vision

**Be My Coverage1 (BMC1-COV)** is a decentralized car insurance platform under the broader **BMC1** ecosystem. It aims to replace traditional insurance models with a blockchain-based system powered by smart contracts, vault systems, and token governance. All systems will be fueled by the **BMC1 utility token**, ensuring transparency, efficiency, and full decentralization.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

- Set up environment: VSC, Hardhat, Solidity, GitHub
- Establish folder and project structure
- Deploy initial sample contract on testnet
- Deep dive into Solidity: structs, modifiers, events
- Map out the full vault + policy architecture

**Deliverables:**
- `contracts/` structure with basic placeholders
- Test deployment script
- Visual architecture map of vault and policy flow

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Vault System Development (Weeks 2‚Äì3)

- Create all vault contracts (Vault35, Vault65, VaultPol1‚Äì3, VaultLock, VaultPool, etc.)
- Implement logic for: deposits, penalties, access control
- Add reusable base contract
- Introduce `VaultBurn` mechanism to simulate deflation or penalties

**Deliverables:**
- All vaults deployed to testnet
- Unit tested contract functions
- Security pattern check: access control, overflow prevention

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Policy Lifecycle Logic (Week 4)

- Develop `PolicyManager.sol` to handle:
  - Premium payments
  - Missed payments and penalties
  - Policy status (active, cancelled, grace period)
- Link vaults to policy actions

**Deliverables:**
- Complete lifecycle policy logic contract
- Unit tests for full user flow
- Documentation for vault-to-policy relationship

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Claims & Payout Logic (Week 5)

- Build `ClaimManager.sol`:
  - Submit claim
  - Review (admin or governance)
  - Trigger payout from appropriate vault
- Simulate simple dispute flow

**Deliverables:**
- Claim contract logic with status flow
- Simulated payout routing
- Integrated with vault balances and policy status

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Governance Engine (Week 6)

- Create `Governance.sol`:
  - Voting system using BMC1 token
  - Proposal system for policy changes or large claim approvals
- Include roles: admin, voter, viewer

**Deliverables:**
- Governance module deployed and connected
- Proposal + voting examples
- Simulated decentralized insurance governance

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: View-Only Vault Dashboard (Week 7)

- Frontend using React + TailwindCSS
- Web3.js or Ethers.js integration
- Display:
  - Vault balances
  - Claim queue
  - Premium inflow/outflow stats
- Hosted on Netlify or Vercel for demo

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional dashboard UI
- Connected to testnet data
- Responsive and visually clean design

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 7: Optimization, Audit & Deployment (Week 8)

- Conduct full audit checklist
- Optimize gas usage in contracts
- Final deploy to Mumbai (Polygon Testnet)
- Prepare for whitepaper & pitch

**Deliverables:**
- Testnet live contracts
- Complete test coverage
- GitHub repo with README, ROADMAP, LICENSE
- Deployment guide for investors/developers

---

## üîÅ Extra Recommendations

- Maintain a **daily devlog** in `journal.md`
- Request regular code reviews (use GitHub Issues)
- Keep architecture diagrams and flow charts updated
- Draft 1-page investor pitch + lightpaper after week 8
